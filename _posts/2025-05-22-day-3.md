### What I Set Out to Do
On Day 3< I knew I had no school, and I had two more problems to finish in this project, so I set out, starting from 10 am, and working till now on this final project. I had two medium problems, one concerning randomness, and one that I thought would have me utilise a variety (or at least some) forms of data storage. I needed to challenge myself on all the knowledge I'd learned thus far. The first medium problem asked me to take an input, and count the long sequence of numbers within this input. The second asked me to assess two different inputs, and with one, set my range of randomness, and the second, return an output with the desired number of outputs.

### What I Actually Did
Of course, as I had to, I finished these two problems, with the second medium problem taking me a good bit longer than the first one. For the first problem, as I usually do, I spent a good amount of time tinkering around. I looked back at mission 7 to see if my work there with the dice sequences with Yahtzee was applicable here, but I found out quickly they weren't. I then just had to experiment with mini code snippets on separating and organizing two different lists, one with scraps that could start a sequence, and the other with the pieces of the sequence itself. Once I got this part done, the rest of the code became easier to solve, as I just had to match up sequences. I then used my knowledge from my past days of work, and I constantly redefined a value, my longest clause, till I sucessfully found a result. The second piece of code was a lot harder, and it required me to utilise random, a topic we briefly covered. A lot of my work here was done through searching through past trainings to see what we'd learned about random, in order to see what I could do to tackle this problem. I didnt want to use any information that we hadn't learned, and risk being penalised. Eventually, after a VERY long search, I found in training 13, I found random.shuffle, which helped me greatly. From there, I simply shuffled the inputs a certain amount of times, and dished it out till my outputs length was the same as the defined amount of wanted outputs.

### What I Learned or Noticed
Mostly random.shuffle, and its capabilities. I was mostly reviewing all the knowledge from the past semester, even referring back to work I did on a previous level up. It was very satisfying to see my apply everything that I've learned not just through this semester, but principles I've learned from earlier problems in this project. I've learned a lot this semester.

### What's Next
Peer reviews, and my tip.
