### What I Set Out to Do

On day 1, I primarily wanted to solve one of my 5 problems, preferably an easy one. I wanted to do this so I could have some starting momentum for this project, and so I'd have something to present to the class.

### What I Actually Did

I did just that, and I persevered through a problem I'd otherwise have to take a break for, in order to finish it in time for my presentation. The first problem required me to convert Roman numerals to regular integers we deal with on a daily basis, and this task wasn't too difficult to code after I'd decided what path I wanted to take. Only a couple of issues with my else statements, but I realised I had to create a second else statement, for when I wasnt dealing with two letters at once.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned how to use dictionaries as an effective sourcing tool for me to simultaneously navigate through i values, and knowing how to directly access a needed output from a dictionary. It's crazy how something we learned just a week ago can come in so handy in this final project
