### What I Set Out to Do
On day 1, I primarily wanted to solve one of my 5 problems, preferably an easy one. I wanted to do this so I could have some starting momentum for this project, and so I'd have something to present to the class.

### What I Actually Did

I did just that, and I persevered through a problem I'd otherwise have to take a break for, in order to finish it in time for my presentation. The first problem required me to convert Roman numerals to regular integers we deal with on a daily basis, and this task wasn't too difficult to code after I'd decided what path I wanted to take. Only a couple of issues with my else statements, but I realised I had to create a second else statement, for when I wasnt dealing with two letters at once.

### What I Learned or Noticed

When I first started this project, I wanted to incorporate all the knowledge that I'd gathered throughout this semester, and I'm only one problem in, and I'm beginning to see how much of my pool of knowledge these LeetCode problems are demanding. I already had to utilise a dictionary in order to help me call values, and we just learned about dictionaries a week ago. Hopefully, the medium questions won't be too hard.
