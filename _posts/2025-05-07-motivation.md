### Project Focus

5 LeetCode Problems with Muhammad
For my project, I want to challenge myself and utilise all the knowledge I've gathered this semester to solve 5 randomly chosen problems from LeetCode.

### Why This Project 

During my time in this class, I felt the most satisfaction after I spent hours working through a difficult problem in a mission or training, and finally getting my code to work. That's why when I was looking through the possible final quest projects, this one stood out to me, as it gave me time to once again on my own pace, tackle a couple of problems before the semester ends.

### What I Want to Learn

I mostly want to use this as an opportunity to use everything we've learned this semester in a variety of problems. I don't think I'll learn too much, but I want to practice more difficult concepts like while loops and dictionaries in these final 5 problems I'll be doing, to help lock in this knowledge in my brain for the long term, and keeping me from forgetting it as soon as the semester ends. 



### My Approach 

I want to move at a steady pace, tackling one problem a day for all the easy problems, and then allowing myself two days per problem for any medium problems I'll be attempting. I'll be having lots of finals and final assignments in the upcoming weeks, so I want to make sure to allow this project the time it needs, so I can hopefully have a good amount of work/knowledge ready to present on Monday.

### What's Next

Getting started on my problems, preferably one at a time, but if I'm struggling on one, I may move on to another, and return to it.
